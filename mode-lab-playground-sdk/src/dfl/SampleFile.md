Invest:
Half of High Risk Investment -> Bitcoin
Half of High Risk Investment -> Apple

otherwise:
Remaining Allowed =

Investment Amount = Lesser( 10 % Salary, 1750.00)
High Risk Investment = 0.5 % Investment Amount
Medium Risk Investment = 80 % Investment Amount
Low Risk Investment = Investment Amount - ( High Risk Investment + Medium Risk Investment )

PORTION is:

- either 10% or 1750 whichever is smaller of my Salary
  // JavaScript const portion = min(percent(10, salary), 1750)

// Portion is: either 10% or 1750 whichever is smaller of my Salary
const portion = min(percent(10, salary), 1750)
