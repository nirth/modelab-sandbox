  - 6, 7 - First Week-End
  - 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 - Second Week-Days

## Ubiquotous Language

**PaymentAccount:** Is an umbrella term to refer to the various ways to store assets, such as but not limited to: **Bank Account**, **Crypo Currency Wallets**, **Securities Accounts** for Investments, **Smart Contract Addresses**, etc.

**Protagonist:** Main **Actor**, usually the one who is simulating customer in question, or any other significant party, and reason to run simulation. By convention protagonist is usually named _Alice_, but doesn’t have to be. In more complex scenarios - there could be no need for protagonist, since multiple parties have equal importance.

**Actor:** One of the actors in the **PaymentScenario**, participant of the transaction, such as Customers, or other parties, e.g. Utilities Companies, Banks, etc.
