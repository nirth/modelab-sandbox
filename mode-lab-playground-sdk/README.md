- For the purposes of the Playground we are using simplified date â€“ Every month has 28 days. Which makes it easier to calculate Week-Days and Week-Ends, which are:
  - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - First Week-Days
  - 6, 7 - First Week-End
  - 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 - Second Week-Days
  - 13, 14 - Second Week-End
  - 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 - Third Week-Days
  - 20, 21 - Third Week-End
  - 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 - Fourth Week Days,
